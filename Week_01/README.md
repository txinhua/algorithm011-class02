### priority queue
A priority queue does not permit null elements. A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in ClassCastException)
A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal capacity governing the size of an array used to store the elements on the queue
